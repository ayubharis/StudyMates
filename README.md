# StudyMates
This app was created at StarterHacks 2019.

Ever wanted an easy way to find other people nearby to study or share another activity with? If so,then StudyMates is the app for you!

StudyMates allows you to easily and efficiently create a group of people to study or do anything else with. When you create a group, other people nearby who are looking for the same activity can see your group on the map and join you!
This app is the solution to the isolation and loneliness problem present in many educational institutions. By allowing those people to meet new people to work with, in addition to increasing their productivity, this platform can also allow many people suffering from social anxiety to meet others with similiar interests in a non-threatening way!

This app is simply a prototype and is not intended to be functional!
